All changes in werf go through all stability channels:

- `alpha` channel can bring new features but can be unstable;
- `beta` channel is for more broad testing of new features to catch regressions;
- `ea` channel is mostly safe and can be used in non-critical environments or for local development;
- `stable` channel is mostly safe and we encourage you to use this version everywhere.
  We **guarantee** that `ea` release should become `stable` not earlier than 1 week after internal tests;
- `rock-solid` channel is a generally available version and recommended for use in critical environments with tight SLAs.
  We **guarantee** that `stable` release should become a `rock-solid` release not earlier than after 2 weeks of extensive testing.

The relations between channels and werf releases are described in [multiwerf.json](https://github.com/werf/werf/blob/multiwerf/multiwerf.json). The usage of werf within the channel should be carried out with [multiwerf](https://github.com/werf/multiwerf). 

> When using release channels, you do not specify a version, because the version is managed automatically within the channel
  
Stability channels and frequent releases allow receiving continuous feedback on new changes, quickly rolling problem changes back, ensuring the high stability of the software, and preserving an acceptable development speed at the same time.
