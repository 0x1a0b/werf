werf is a mature, reliable tool you can trust:

- [5 stability levels](#stability-channels) are available, from _alpha_ to _stable_ & _rock-solid_. All changes in werf go through each of them, and transitions to the most stable channels require specific periods of preliminary testing. This all guarantees certain levels of stability from which users can choose.
- Most of werf code is covered with automatic (e2e and unit) tests.
- In [Flant](https://flant.com/), werf is being used in production since 2016 for building and since 2017 for deploying hundreds of applications. These apps are extremely diverse in sizes, designs, and technology stacks being used. We know at least dozens of other businesses using werf for years.
- If there are any concerns on using werf, please welcome to our online communities ([Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/werf_io)) and feel free to ask the questions you might have â€” we are happy to help!
